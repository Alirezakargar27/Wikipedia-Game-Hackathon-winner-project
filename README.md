Wikipedia Guessing Game

This project is a result of a three-day hackathon organized by Master School in March 2024 (only two months into begging of our training on Python!). Our team, clinched the winning prize in this event.

*Description*
The Wikipedia Guessing Game is an interactive game built upon the Wikipedia library. Players compete to guess link titles within randomly selected Wikipedia articles, testing their knowledge and accuracy in an exciting challenge.

*How to Play*
Setup: Players must enter the number of participants and their names to initialize the game.
Guessing: Players take turns guessing titles of related links based on the initially chosen one. Guesses must contain a minimum of 5 letters to keep the game engaging.
Validation: The game validates each guess to determine if it's correct. Each player is allowed three incorrect guesses before being disqualified.
Scoring: Once all players have completed their turns, the game ranks them based on their number of correct guesses.
